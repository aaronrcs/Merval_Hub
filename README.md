Using the Marvel API to access character information.

# Merval API User Interface

Allows Users to perform a search using our Merval API.

The UI allows the users to do the following:

- Indicate to the User the type of search that is available, so the User knows what to type into the input field.
- When the search results are returned, the users are presented with a search result list.
- The user has an option to select the a result and be able to view the details of the result selected.
- The users are able to create a new search after their current search.
- The UI displays the previous searches in real-time.
  - Allows the user to click on one of the previous searches.
  - If clicked, the user is presented with the search results.
